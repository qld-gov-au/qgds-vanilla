Overview
--------

A callout is a piece of text from an article that has been taken out and used as a visual aid to help show a reader where important information is located.

Callouts are sometimes referred to as "pull quotes" or "highlighted text." In our Design System callouts can also be used as a visual clue to help direct a user's attention to important pieces of information. Our design system also uses a modified callout style for quotes and dates.

Callout examples
----------------

### Default callout

Example

Theme

*    White
*    Light

Usage guidelines for callouts
-----------------------------

Our callout can contain a title and a message.

Callouts should be brief and to the point. They should convey the most important information in just a few words. Always place them strategically in a location that makes sense in relation to the surrounding text. Keep in mind callouts should always relate to the surrounding text and provide additional value to the reader.

Some users don’t notice callouts. Therefore, don't use a callout for important pieces of information.

### Success status icon Indicates a success state When to use

*   Call attention to important pieces of information
*   Supplement a point in the main text
*   For quotes and important dates
*   Link to a relevant resource or supply additional important information
*   Summaries
*   Checklists
*   Examples
*   Case studies
*   Definitions

### Status cancel icon Cancel icon or warning icon When not to use

*   Too many callouts can be overwhelming and actually detract from the user experience, use them sparingly and only when necessary
*   Don't use callouts for block quotes or figures

### Information status icon Indicates that information is required or toggles a tooltip How to use

Quote example
-------------

Use the quote callout component for block quotations of longer than about 30 words.

A quote callout component has:

*   quote text
*   reference (for cited quotations only).

Example

Theme

*    White
*    Light
*    Alt
*    Dark
*    Dark-alt

We build it now so that those who come to it later will be able to create things we cannot ourselves imagine. </blockquote> <!-- The figcaption tag is used to provide a caption for the figure. In this case, it's the name of the author of the quote. --> <figcaption class="qld__quote-source"> Sir Tim Berners-Lee </figcaption> </figure>`

Usage guidelines for quotes
---------------------------

### Success status icon Indicates a success state When to use

*   show direct speech and the quoted work of other writers
*   enclose the title of certain works
*   draw attention to a word you’re defining.

### Status cancel icon Cancel icon or warning icon When not to use

*   For pull-quotes

### Information status icon Indicates that information is required or toggles a tooltip How to use quotes

Read more about when to use text boxes and callouts in the [Australian Government Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/quotation-marks#format_long_quotes_as_block_quotes_with_no_quotation_marks "https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/quotation-marks#format_long_quotes_as_block_quotes_with_no_quotation_marks").

Research and rationale
----------------------

Our callout design is based on the [Australian Government Design](https://gold.designsystemau.org/components/callout "https://gold.designsystemau.org/components/callout/") system pattern where a thick lefthand border, background colours, and padding are used enhance the visual weight of the callouts. The research conducted by the Digital Transformation agency indicated that this was done to address [WCAG2.0 Criterion 1.4.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html "https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html").

### Colour

The callout component has been designed so that it will automatically use the appropriate colours depending on the background colour the container it's placed within. A darker shade of the existing background colour is used to differentiate the callout from its background in a way that isn't too overwhelming. This is done so that callouts still call attention to themselves but are always subordinate to other notification style components such as in-page alerts which convey more important information.

Our quote style uses some of the same visual design patterns as the callout for consistency. This is because consistency is a fundamental principle of Design Systems.

The key difference between callouts and quotes is that they don't have a background shade, this was intentionally done so that quote would look district to callouts but have less visual weight than the default design. We were also inspired by the W3C Design System that had a very similar design.

### Semantics

Our quote was influenced by the W3C Design System which had provided best practice of the correct semantic markup and accessibility requirements. ([W3C Design System](https://design-system.w3.org/components/quote.html "https://design-system.w3.org/components/quote.html"), 2023).

### Quotation marks

We follow the Australian Government Style Manual which states that you shouldn't use quotation marks to identify the quoted material – the formatting does that instead. Block quotes should also be coded with the HTML <blockquote> element (Digital Transformation Agency n.d.).

Accessible callout requirements
-------------------------------

Keep these considerations in mind if you're modifying the Design System or creating a custom component.

### Aria roles

You can also use the <role=“complementary”> attribute to define an ARIA complementary landmark. Use this when it sits outside the <main> content.

Example of a callout outside the main content, using role="complementary"

`<div role="complementary"> <p>This is a callout that provides complementary information. It can be understood even when separated from the main content.</p> </div>`

Alternatively, use the <role=“region”> attribute and assign a name if the content needs to sit within the <main> section of a page.

Example of a callout within the main content, using role="region" and aria-label to provide a name

`<main> <p>This is the main content of the webpage...</p>  <div role="region" aria-label="Helpful Callout"> <p>This is a callout that provides additional information related to the main content.</p> </div> </main>`

Accessible quote requirements
-----------------------------

### WCAG guidelines

#### 1.3.1 Info and Relationships

Structure the quote component using semantic HTML elements such as <blockquote> and <cite> for quotations and sources, respectively. This will ensure the information is conveyed effectively to screen reader users.

##### **Considerations**

There seems to be some debate and different approaches for the correct implementation of the <cite> element. Our approach is to use the cite element for a URLs and sources but never for authors and names. This is the same approach taken by the [W3C Design System](https://design-system.w3.org/components/quote.html "https://design-system.w3.org/components/quote.html") and [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite") both of these use figure and fig-caption in conjunction with the <blockquote> element for citing the authors.

#### 1.4.1 Use of Colour

Ensure colour isn't used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. For example out callouts and quote designs have a thick left-hand border as an indicator.

#### 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)

Ensure that the text colour and background colour of the quote have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 to accommodate users with low vision or colour deficiencies.

#### 2.4.6 Headings and Labels

If the quote is part of a larger section or article, use clear and descriptive headings to help users navigate through the content.
